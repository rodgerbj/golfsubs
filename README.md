## My first project in Joomla.  
As of version **1.0.0**, I've created a membership table containing name, email and phone.
Server and Client validation have been added for name and email.  Phone stores anything.  Should only accept 10 digits. 
Would also like a phone input "mask" for area code, 3 and 4.
